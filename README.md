## FAQ
<details>
<summary>Q: It asks for administrator permissions?</summary>

A: This script needs those permissions to modify files and settings. The full source code of this script is available in this repository for auditing.</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Is this a virus?</summary>

A: Windows might say that it is a virus, but that is a false positive. As stated above, the full source code for this script is available for auditing.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: I found a bug/issue! What do I do?</summary>

A: Update to the latest version. If the issue persists, check the open issues and [the known issues](https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper/blob/main/README.md#known-issues) for any issues that I am aware of. If it's not there, open up an issue describing your problem and how to reproduce it. I'll work on it as soon as I can.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Will more features be added?</summary>

A: Yes! They are all in the Future Features section below. Any help with the future features is greatly appreciated!
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Will this affect Adobe apps in any negative way?</summary>

A: No, it won't. If you do have Adobe apps (Photoshop, After Effects, etc.) open, it will close them if you decide to end Adobe processes. Other than that, everything should work normally. Please open an issue if this is not the case.

## Future Features
> These are features that I'd like to implement in the future. If you can help, please open a thread in the discussions tab, under the "Development" category, or if you have code already, open a pull request! 

- [ ] Patch Retention
  - Locks the patched file from genP so that nothing can modify/delete it
  - I'm stuck at setting a list of filepaths that the script can read off and patch.
- [ ] Revamp the ProcessKill script
  - Currently, the script stops any process that mentions `Adobe` in its `Company Name` attribute. It is a "'shotgun' approach" as stated by [the creator](https://gist.github.com/carcheky/530fd85ffff6719486038542a8b5b997#gistcomment-3586740) of the command. It'll kill any CC app (Photoshop, Premiere, etc.) running, destroying unsaved work.
  - Getting individual processes and blocking them is unfeasible, as Adobe changes that every time they sneeze
- [ ] Running in background
  - tbh i have no idea where to even start with this
  - Goal: have an option to run the ProcessKill script every set interval 
- [ ] Backup documentation/scripts
## Known Issues
> There are more issues in the [issues](https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper/issues) section; these are just the most common ones.

**Issue:** Error message: `the execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Please see "get-help about_signing" for more details.` or pushing the "Remove AGS" button gives no results.

Fix: Run `set-executionpolicy remotesigned` in an administrator powershell window, or manually execute the `ProcessKill.ps1` script in the scripts folder once (you can use CCStopper running the script for the first time manually). [Credit to /u/getblownaparte on Reddit for bringing this issue up](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/comments/ndhm94/i_made_a_script_to_stop_all_adobe_background/gyb0twq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

---

**Issue:** Error message: `The argument '.\scripts\ProcessKill.ps1' to the -File parameter does not exist. Provide the path to an existing file as an argument to the -File parameter.` and no apps are closed.

**Fix:** Update to the latest version of the script.

---

**Issue:** Error message: `The target registry key cannot be found, or it has been edited already. Cannot proceed with Acrobat fix.` and there is no value in the registry.

**Fix:** Create a DWORD value (in the registry) called `IsAMTEnforced` with a value of 1. You will not need to patch Acrobat with the script after this.

## Disclaimer/Notice

**Disclaimer:** This script is in an early stage, and offered as-is. There will be bugs. I am not responsible for any damage, loss of data, or thermonuclear wars caused by these scripts. I am not affiliated with Adobe.

**Notice:** Don't use this tool for piracy. It's illegal, and multi-billion dollar companies like Adobe _needs_ to profit off unreliable and overpriced software. Piracy _helps_ Adobe by increasing their market dominance. If you want to dethrone Adobe, use [alternatives](https://ass.easun.me).
